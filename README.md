# sca-capacitor-allocation

Optimal capacitor allocation in distribution systems using the Sine Cosine Algorithm (http://www.alimirjalili.com/SCA.html).
The simulations are run using OpenDSS (https://sourceforge.net/projects/electricdss/), so make sure to install that.

This was done as my final project for a electrical engineer degree.

The code is written in Python 2 and is a bit messy.
